## Abstract
The rapid advent spatially resolved transcriptomics techniques have given rise to map transcripts at single-cell resolution in various types of cancer. Here, we construct a comprehensive spatial meta-transcriptome resource by manually curated 93 FFPE slices from 18 cancers encompassing 174,594 spots and 562,105 cells from scRNA‚Äêseq. We construct SMTdb (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/SMTdb/), to enable vast interactively data exploration of spatial distribution and expression of microbiota, host gene modules associated with certain microbiota and co-occurrence between microbiota and immune cells within tumor microenvironment. The atlas resource serves as a one-stop and time-effective platform to investigate the interactions among microbial ecosystems and host.
